As I was playing _Hungry Cat Nonogram_ I realized I was using a strict set of rules. It seems like the sort of thing that a computer could do better than I could. It seems like it would be more fun to program a solution than to solve things myself.

I am aware that other people have created a solver for this game.

See it live at https://tradeideasphilip.github.io/hungry-cat-nonogram-solver/.
It's still pretty rough.
You probably want to open the JavaScript console.
